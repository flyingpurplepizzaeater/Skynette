## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Five phases derived from requirement categories (STAB, PROV, EDIT, AIED, INTG, QUAL)
- [Research]: Use google-genai SDK (not deprecated google-generativeai) for Gemini
- [Research]: Use xai-sdk for Grok provider
- [Research]: Use Pygments for syntax highlighting (598 languages, no Flutter wrapper complexity)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Flet code editor performance with large files (1000+ lines) not benchmarked
- [Research]: Grok rate limits less documented than OpenAI/Anthropic
- [Research]: State management refactor needed before editor adds more complexity (AIHubView at 1669 lines)
