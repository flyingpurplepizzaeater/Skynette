## v3+ Requirements (Deferred)

### Advanced Agent

- **ADVN-01**: Multi-agent coordination (agent spawns sub-agents)
- **ADVN-02**: Cross-session memory (remember context between sessions)
- **ADVN-03**: Learning from feedback (improve based on user corrections)

### Platform

- **PLAT-01**: Mobile-optimized agent interface
- **PLAT-02**: Team permission model for shared agents
- **PLAT-03**: Agent marketplace (share/discover agent configurations)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mobile native apps | Web/desktop first; mobile can access via web |
| Real-time collaboration | Single-user focus for v3; complexity too high |
| Plugin marketplace | SDK exists but marketplace deferred |
| Custom model training | Use pre-trained models only |
| Email integration | Users add via MCP servers |
| Stock market integration | Users add via MCP servers |
| Multi-agent coordination | Complexity, defer to v3.1+ |
