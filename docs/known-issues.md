# Known Issues - Phase 3 Sprint 3

## UI Limitations

- **Drag and Drop**: Not yet implemented for canvas nodes
- **Connection Validation**: No cycle detection in UI (engine prevents cycles)
- **Undo/Redo**: Not implemented

## Performance Notes

- Canvas tested with up to 50 nodes
- Larger workflows (100+ nodes) may require optimization

## Future Enhancements

- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Node search in palette
- Workflow templates
- Export/import workflows
